I am passionate about web development, I started by curiosity and the instruction of good teachers and friends. I consider myself as a self-taught person, who likes being in constant learning and to be trendy about web technologies.

My priority in the development is the user experience making interactive webapps, I consider as my favorite stack the use of tools like Grunt, with LiveReload and Sass/Compass for CSS. I Build mobile applications with PhoneGap.

I am delighted with JavaScript and I'm currently learning to develop with frameworks like Angular and Node.js and strikes me using Arduino to interact with a webapp, I also love to create graphics with Processing and create sounds with SuperCollider.
